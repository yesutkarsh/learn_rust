3. Let's craete a project using cargo
-> move to root directory
-> run command cargo new Day2_hello_cargo --bin

here in above command 
cargo -> tells terminal to user cargo pakcage manger

new > is cargo subcommand, it create brand new rust object.

Day2_hello_cargo is name of project

--bin > this flag means we are telling to "Create a binary project"

a binary project means it will have a runnable programe and a main function.


>> Inside project
 1. Cargo.toml  ( Tom's obvious, Minimal Language create by Tom Preston)

 2. Inside src we have our main.rs, the file where we can code everything

 3. On running cargo build it build our project and put compiled build files output in targer folder.

 4. Inde targert/debug we have out Day2_hello_cargo executable file which we can manully execute or we can run command cargo run to execute.

 5. Things about cargo run  
    -- If there is no chnage cargo run will automatically not compile but direcly run the file.

    -- If there is chnage it will complie first

    -- we can use cargo check command to check for type err or complie err.

    -- hence cargo check hep use to fasten up development process by letting use check for err without building every time.
